 ar club paddle will be moved, but as the Medway above Yalding wiil be drain
 ed we are considering paddling on the Thames launching at Walton Bridge. Th
 ere is a free car park and a cafe on the sount bank just by the bridge. Fro
 m there we can paddle upstream to Shepperton or downstream towards Hampton 
 Court. It will mean a earlier meeting at the club, 8:30, to load boats.&nbs
 p;\n\n\n&nbsp;If interested please register when this is available.&nbsp;\n
 \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOur regular weekly paddle sessions for members 
 both new and experienced. &nbsp;\n\n\nIf you're a newer member or would lik
 e some support on the water, please use the booking form below and one of o
 ur PAAs will meet you for a paddle. &nbsp;If you're confident in your abili
 ty to paddle independently with the main group, please&nbsp;don't use the b
 ooking form - just turn up - and leave the spaces for those who need it.\n\
 n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nBooking opens 2 weeks in advance.\n
