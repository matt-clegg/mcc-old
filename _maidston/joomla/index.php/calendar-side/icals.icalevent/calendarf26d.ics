SUMMARY:Exe & Barle Trip 2022
LOCATION:Exe Valley Caravan Site\, Bridgetown\, TA22 9JN
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:<h2><strong>The Exe &amp; Barle Trip is back!</strong></h2><p><img src="ima
 ges/igallery/original/301-400/River_Exe.jpg" alt="River Exe" width="595" he
 ight="446" /></p><article><p>Staying at the Exe Valley Caravan Site in Brid
 getown near Dulverton and paddling the River Exe and Barle predominately, t
 his yearly occurring trip has been the first whitewater trip for many membe
 rs at the club! The rivers are grade 1 to 2 unless in spate but are unlikel
 y to be big this year due to the lack of rain (so everyone needs to do thei
 r rain dancing).</p><p>We tend to travel down at varying times on the Frida
 y and leave straight from the paddle on the Sunday, 2 nights of camping so 
 bring your tents, food and any other provisions. Usually we eat out on the 
 Friday (if you arrive in time) and Saturday night at the local hostelry, th
 e Badgers Holt is walking distance if open. Price per night to camp is £5.5
 0 per person with electric hook-ups at £4 per day.</p><p>This trip will hop
 efully run as a peer paddle AND a led group for the less experienced/first 
 timers. If you want to be led you will need to sign up for the event to mak
 e sure we have enough river leader cover. The trip is suitable for anyone w
 ho has whitewater experience at this grade (Lee Valley assessment or Intro'
  to Whitewater course attendees) but is not a coached trip and therefore no
  newbies to moving water I'm afraid. If you are unsure please contact me be
 fore booking: <a href="mailto:chairman@maidstonecanoeclub.net?subject=2022%
 20Exe%20%26%20Barle%20Trip%20enquiry" target="_blank">chairman@maidstonecan
 oeclub.net</a></p><p>If you are old hands and able to join the peer paddler
 s please just drop me an email so I have an idea of numbers. ONLY BOOK ON H
 ERE IF YOU REQUIRE TO BE LED. There will be limited numbers available in th
 e booking section so please leave them for the less experienced. Any querie
 s, again feel free to email me:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:chairman@maidstonecano
 eclub.net">chairman@maidstonecanoeclub.net</a></p><p>This is a classic easy
  whitewater trip, so the more the merrier. Don't forget this is still movin
 g water and you will require a suitable boat (ask the bosun if you want to 
 use a club boat), helmet, bouyancy aid, spray deck and suitable clothing de
 pending on the weather. We will be eating lunch at locations down the river
 s and so you will need to carry whatever you wish to eat (so waterproof con
 tainers etc).</p><p>&nbsp;</p></article>
