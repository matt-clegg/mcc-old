SUMMARY:Explore Award - Independent Paddling
LOCATION:Maidstone Canoe Club\, Mill Meadow\, St Peter's St\, Maidstone\, ME16 0SN
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:\n\nThe Explore Award is a step&nbsp;up from the Beginner Course.&nbsp; It 
 replaces the old 2* award, and is suitable for anyone who's done the old 1*
 , Discover Award, or Beginner Course - and has had a bit of paddle time sin
 ce to gain some experience.&nbsp; The focus of this is to build the skills 
 needed to paddle independently and to be a confident member of a paddling g
 roup.&nbsp; It will also provide the foundations to progress in other paddl
 e disciplines - whether that's sea kayaking, touring, white water, or anyth
 ing else. &nbsp;\n\n\nWe'll talk about:\n\n - planning a trip, taking into 
 account the weather, environment, and water conditions\n - new skills and p
 addle strokes for new situations\n - efficient paddling to prepare you for 
 longer journeys\n - basic rescue skills (these can be done in a pool if the
  river is too cold)\n - and lots more!\n\nPart of the assessment for this a
 ward is for the group to plan and paddle a short journey. &nbsp;It's usuall
 y good to spend some time practicing between the training and assessment, a
 nd even if you think you're not at the level quite yet it's still worth doi
 ng the training now. &nbsp;You'll learn loads, have fun, and can do the ass
 essment journey later when you've had the opportunity for a bit more practi
 ce!\n\n\nTo get the most out of this award, you should:\n\n - be confident 
 wearing a spraydeck (and capsizing with one!)\n - be able to paddle compete
 ntly in a straight line\n - have a chat with a PAA or river leader who has 
 done the award\n\nTime: This course will run on Tuesday &nbsp;evenings (6:0
 0pm on the water) in July, with an assessment date to be decided.&nbsp; If 
 you can't make one or more of the sessions then we can try to arrange anoth
 er time.\n\n\nCost: British Canoeing charge Â£6 for this course - please pay
  via Paypal below. &nbsp;Coaching is always free at Maidstone Canoe Club!\n
