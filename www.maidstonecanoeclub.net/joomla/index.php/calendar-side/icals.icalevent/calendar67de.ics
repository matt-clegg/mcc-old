SUMMARY:PEER Paddle - Yantra and Danube rivers - Bulgaria
LOCATION:Bulgaria
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:<h1>Yantra and Danube rivers kayaking trip in Bulgaria.</h1><p><img src="im
 ages/IMG_2903a.jpg" alt="IMG 2903a" width="899" height="506" /></p><p>This 
 is a possibility to embark on a trip down Yantra and Danube rivers in Bulga
 ria. The Danube is the second longest river in Europe, crossing 10 countrie
 s. It forms the border between Bulgaria and Romania and in this area, it is
  relatively wild with a lot of protected territories and abundant wildlife 
 and birds.<br />The trip is not in any way luxurious. The aim is to enjoy t
 he nature, the passion for travel and adventure and the joy of the outdoors
 .<br />The river trip is planned as a totally relaxing experience. There ar
 e no elements of white-water kayaking. You will be properly instructed and 
 led by experienced guides and you will be provided with a BA. During the tr
 ip we will see some beautiful natural sites and we might get a chance to vi
 sit some cultural and historical places.</p><p><img src="images/IMG_5044a.j
 pg" alt="IMG 5044a" width="900" height="506" /></p><p>The following program
  is to illustrate how the trip is planned, but all the details and schedule
 s can be changed and revised due to current water level of the rivers, safe
 ty reasons, extreme weather or reasons beyond the organizer’s control.</p><
 h2>Day 1</h2><h4>Thursday, 11 May</h4><p>Arrival at Sofia Airport. Pick-up 
 and transfer to Belyanovo village, near Rousse (approx. 160 miles, 3:30 hrs
 ).<br />Welcome dinner.<br />We spend the next 4 nights in a typical cosy h
 ouse in a very quiet and low-key village.</p><p><img src="images/IMG_202007

 /p><h2>Days 2 – 4</h2><h4>Friday – Sunday, 12 – 14 May</h4><p>In the next 3
  days we will paddle down Yantra river.<br />The routes are 20 – 38 km (12 
 – 24 miles) per day, approx. 4–6-hour trips. The exact start and finish poi
 nts for each day will be determined depending on river levels and the weath
 er. Each morning we will start with tea, coffee and breakfast in the house.
  We will have a transfer to the starting point. If there is such an option,
  we will get lunch somewhere along the way. If not, we could prepare a smal
 l packed lunch in the morning. After we are done with kayaking for the day,
  our vehicles will be waiting for us at the end point and they would take u
 s back to our accommodation. There, we will enjoy dinner. We will have time
  and options for short walks in the area.</p><p><img src="images/Yantraa.jp

 s 5 – 6</h2><h4>Monday – Tuesday, 15 – 16 May</h4><p>After we reach the mou
 th of Yantra river we will continue down the Danube. As we enter the large 
 river we will be in international waters and we will be taking some extra c
 aution because some large ships may be passing us. We will have a small sup
 port boat accompanying us, as is required to be kayaking on the Danube in t
 his section. We will reach and pass the large town of Rousse, where we will
  sleep the next two nights. We will skip the river section with the industr
 ial ports and we will continue below town. In Rousse we will be staying in 
 a small family hotel. In the evenings, we will have can explore the town ce
 ntre and have dinner at some local pubs and restaurants. In the mornings we
  will have tea, coffee and breakfast at the hotel. Lunch will again depend 
 on whether we pass some pubs, or we could pack our own lunch to go. Our kay
 aking trips will again be 20-40 km (12 – 25 miles) per day. To get to the s
 tarting points and to get back from the finish, we would be taking vehicle 
 transfers, which will be private and prearranged.</p><p><img src="images/DS
