SUMMARY:PEER Paddle - Yantra and Danube rivers - Bulgaria
LOCATION:Bulgaria
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:Yantra and Danube rivers kayaking trip in Bulgaria.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a poss
 ibility to embark on a trip down Yantra and Danube rivers in Bulgaria. The 
 Danube is the second longest river in Europe, crossing 10 countries. It for
 ms the border between Bulgaria and Romania and in this area, it is relative
 ly wild with a lot of protected territories and abundant wildlife and birds
 .\nThe trip is not in any way luxurious. The aim is to enjoy the nature, th
 e passion for travel and adventure and the joy of the outdoors.\nThe river 
 trip is planned as a totally relaxing experience. There are no elements of 
 white-water kayaking. You will be properly instructed and led by experience
 d guides and you will be provided with a BA. During the trip we will see so
 me beautiful natural sites and we might get a chance to visit some cultural
  and historical places.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following program is to illustrate h
 ow the trip is planned, but all the details and schedules can be changed an
 d revised due to current water level of the rivers, safety reasons, extreme
  weather or reasons beyond the organizer’s control.\nDay 1Thursday, 11 May\
 n\nArrival at Sofia Airport. Pick-up and transfer to Belyanovo village, nea
 r Rousse (approx. 160 miles, 3:30 hrs).\nWelcome dinner.\nWe spend the next
  4 nights in a typical cosy house in a very quiet and low-key village.\n\n\
 n\nDays 2 – 4Friday – Sunday, 12 – 14 May\n\nIn the next 3 days we will pad
 dle down Yantra river.\nThe routes are 20 – 38 km (12 – 24 miles) per day, 
 approx. 4–6-hour trips. The exact start and finish points for each day will
  be determined depending on river levels and the weather. Each morning we w
 ill start with tea, coffee and breakfast in the house. We will have a trans
 fer to the starting point. If there is such an option, we will get lunch so
 mewhere along the way. If not, we could prepare a small packed lunch in the
  morning. After we are done with kayaking for the day, our vehicles will be
  waiting for us at the end point and they would take us back to our accommo
 dation. There, we will enjoy dinner. We will have time and options for shor
 t walks in the area.\n\n\n\nDays 5 – 6Monday – Tuesday, 15 – 16 May\n\nAfte
 r we reach the mouth of Yantra river we will continue down the Danube. As w
 e enter the large river we will be in international waters and we will be t
 aking some extra caution because some large ships may be passing us. We wil
 l have a small support boat accompanying us, as is required to be kayaking 
 on the Danube in this section. We will reach and pass the large town of Rou
 sse, where we will sleep the next two nights. We will skip the river sectio
 n with the industrial ports and we will continue below town. In Rousse we w
 ill be staying in a small family hotel. In the evenings, we will have can e
 xplore the town centre and have dinner at some local pubs and restaurants. 
 In the mornings we will have tea, coffee and breakfast at the hotel. Lunch 
 will again depend on whether we pass some pubs, or we could pack our own lu
 nch to go. Our kayaking trips will again be 20-40 km (12 – 25 miles) per da
 y. To get to the starting points and to get back from the finish, we would 
 be taking vehicle transfers, which will be private and prearranged.\n\n\n\n
