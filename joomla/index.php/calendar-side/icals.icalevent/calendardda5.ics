SUMMARY:Exe & Barle Trip 2022
LOCATION:Exe Valley Caravan Site\, Bridgetown\, TA22 9JN
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:The Exe &amp; Barle Trip is back!\n\n\n\n\nStaying at the Exe Valley Carava
 n Site in Bridgetown near Dulverton and paddling the River Exe and Barle pr
 edominately, this yearly occurring trip has been the first whitewater trip 
 for many members at the club! The rivers are grade 1 to 2 unless in spate b
 ut are unlikely to be big this year due to the lack of rain (so everyone ne
 eds to do their rain dancing).\n\n\nWe tend to travel down at varying times
  on the Friday and leave straight from the paddle on the Sunday, 2 nights o
 f camping so bring your tents, food and any other provisions. Usually we ea
 t out on the Friday (if you arrive in time) and Saturday night at the local
  hostelry, the Badgers Holt is walking distance if open. Price per night to
  camp is £5.50 per person with electric hook-ups at £4 per day.\n\n\nThis t
 rip will hopefully run as a peer paddle AND a led group for the less experi
 enced/first timers. If you want to be led you will need to sign up for the 
 event to make sure we have enough river leader cover. The trip is suitable 
 for anyone who has whitewater experience at this grade (Lee Valley assessme
 nt or Intro' to Whitewater course attendees) but is not a coached trip and 
 therefore no newbies to moving water I'm afraid. If you are unsure please c
 ontact me before booking: chairman@maidstonecanoeclub.net\n\n\nIf you are o
 ld hands and able to join the peer paddlers please just drop me an email so
  I have an idea of numbers. ONLY BOOK ON HERE IF YOU REQUIRE TO BE LED. The
 re will be limited numbers available in the booking section so please leave
  them for the less experienced. Any queries, again feel free to email me:&n
 bsp;chairman@maidstonecanoeclub.net\n\n\nThis is a classic easy whitewater 
 trip, so the more the merrier. Don't forget this is still moving water and 
 you will require a suitable boat (ask the bosun if you want to use a club b
 oat), helmet, bouyancy aid, spray deck and suitable clothing depending on t
 he weather. We will be eating lunch at locations down the rivers and so you
  will need to carry whatever you wish to eat (so waterproof containers etc)
