SUMMARY:Explore Award - Independent Paddling
LOCATION:Maidstone Canoe Club\, Mill Meadow\, St Peter's St\, Maidstone\, ME16 0SN
DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:<p>The Explore Award is a step&nbsp;up from the Beginner Course.&nbsp; It r
 eplaces the old 2* award, and is suitable for anyone who's done the old 1*,
  Discover Award, or Beginner Course - and has had a bit of paddle time sinc
 e to gain some experience.&nbsp; The focus of this is to build the skills n
 eeded to paddle independently and to be a confident member of a paddling gr
 oup.&nbsp; It will also provide the foundations to progress in other paddle
  disciplines - whether that's sea kayaking, touring, white water, or anythi
 ng else. &nbsp;</p><p>We'll talk about:</p><ul><li>planning a trip, taking 
 into account the weather, environment, and water conditions</li><li>new ski
 lls and paddle strokes for new situations</li><li>efficient paddling to pre
 pare you for longer journeys</li><li>basic rescue skills (these can be done
  in a pool if the river is too cold)</li><li>and lots more!</li></ul><p>Par
 t of the assessment for this award is for the group to plan and paddle a sh
 ort journey. &nbsp;It's usually good to spend some time practicing between 
 the training and assessment, and even if you think you're not at the level 
 quite yet it's still worth doing the training now. &nbsp;You'll learn loads
 , have fun, and can do the assessment journey later when you've had the opp
 ortunity for a bit more practice!</p><p>To get the most out of this award, 
 you should:</p><ul><li>be confident wearing a spraydeck (and capsizing with
  one!)</li><li>be able to paddle competently in a straight line</li><li>hav
 e a chat with a PAA or river leader who has done the award</li></ul><p><str
 ong>Time:</strong> This course will run on Wednesday &nbsp;evenings (6:00pm
  on the water) throughout August, with assessment on the final session.&nbs
 p; If you can't make one or more of the sessions then we can try to arrange
  another time.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: British Canoeing charge Â£6 for 
 this course - please pay via Paypal below. &nbsp;Coaching is always free at
  Maidstone Canoe Club!</p>
